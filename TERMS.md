## 1. Service Description

Clawster.run ("the Service") provides one-click deployment of AI agents into Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) via Phala Cloud infrastructure. We provision, manage, and bill for cloud compute resources on your behalf.

We are an **infrastructure provider**. We do not control, monitor, or take responsibility for the behaviour of AI agents deployed through our Service.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into these terms. By using the Service, you confirm this.

## 3. User Accounts

- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.
- You must provide accurate information during registration.
- One account per person or legal entity.
- We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.

## 4. User Responsibilities

**You are solely responsible for:**

- All API keys you provide (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) and any costs incurred with those providers.
- Compliance with your AI provider's acceptable use policies and terms of service.
- All content generated by your deployed bot(s).
- Ensuring your bot does not engage in illegal activity, harassment, spam, fraud, impersonation, or any activity that violates applicable law.
- Any data your bot collects, processes, or stores, including compliance with data protection laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

**You must not use the Service to:**

- Deploy bots for illegal purposes in any jurisdiction.
- Generate or distribute illegal content.
- Harass, threaten, or abuse any person.
- Send unsolicited messages (spam).
- Impersonate individuals or organisations.
- Attempt to circumvent security measures, access other users' data, or interfere with the Service.
- Mine cryptocurrency or run workloads unrelated to AI agent deployment.

## 5. Data, Privacy & Security

### 5.1 Trusted Execution Environments

Your bot runs inside a hardware-encrypted TEE (Intel TDX). This means:

- Your bot's runtime memory is encrypted by hardware — we cannot read it.
- Your bot's data is isolated from other users and from our infrastructure.
- TEE attestation is available to verify the integrity of the execution environment.

### 5.2 Secret Handling

- API keys and secrets you provide are encrypted to the TEE's public key before deployment.
- We do not store your plaintext API keys after deployment.
- During the deployment process, secrets may be temporarily handled by our systems before encryption. We are working to implement fully client-side encryption to eliminate this window.

### 5.3 Data Retention

- Bot data lives inside the TEE and is destroyed when the CVM is terminated.
- We do not back up or retain your bot's data, conversations, or memory files.
- Account data (email, billing info) is retained as required for our business operations and legal obligations.

### 5.4 Privacy Policy

A separate Privacy Policy governs how we collect, use, and protect personal data. By using the Service, you agree to our Privacy Policy.

## 6. Billing & Payment

- The Service is billed on a usage basis, metered hourly.
- Charges accrue while your CVM is running, regardless of whether your bot is actively processing requests.
- You are responsible for terminating CVMs you no longer need.
- Payments are processed via Stripe. You agree to Stripe's terms of service.
- All fees are in USD unless otherwise stated.
- We reserve the right to change pricing with 30 days notice.

## 7. Service Availability

- The Service is provided on an **"as-is" and "as-available"** basis.
- We do not guarantee any specific uptime, availability, or performance level.
- We depend on third-party infrastructure (Phala Cloud, cloud providers) and are not liable for their outages.
- We may perform maintenance, updates, or changes to the Service at any time.
- We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of planned downtime.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

**To the maximum extent permitted by law:**

- We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.
- We are not liable for any loss of profits, data, business, or goodwill.
- We are not liable for any actions, statements, or content generated by your bot.
- We are not liable for costs incurred with third-party AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).
- Our total aggregate liability for any claims arising from or related to the Service shall not exceed the total fees you have paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Brain&Bot Technologies Ltd, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:

- Your use of the Service.
- Your bot's actions, output, or behaviour.
- Your violation of these terms.
- Your violation of any third party's rights.
- Any claim that content generated by your bot is defamatory, infringing, or otherwise unlawful.

## 10. Intellectual Property

- You retain all rights to your bot configurations, SOUL.md files, and custom content.
- We retain all rights to the Clawster.run platform, code, and branding.
- OpenClaw is open-source software licensed under its own terms. We do not claim ownership of OpenClaw.

## 11. Termination

### By You
- You may terminate your account at any time by deleting all CVMs and contacting us.
- Upon termination, all running CVMs are destroyed and data is irrecoverable.

### By Us
- We may suspend or terminate your account immediately if you violate these terms.
- We may terminate the Service entirely with 30 days notice.
- We will make reasonable efforts to allow data export before termination where feasible.

## 12. Modifications

- We may update these terms at any time.
- Material changes will be communicated via email or the Service dashboard.
- Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
- If you disagree with changes, your remedy is to stop using the Service.

## 13. Governing Law & Disputes

- These terms are governed by the laws of **England and Wales**.
- Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
- Before initiating legal proceedings, both parties agree to attempt resolution through good-faith negotiation for at least 30 days.

## 14. Miscellaneous

- **Severability:** If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
- **Entire Agreement:** These terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Brain&Bot Technologies Ltd.
- **No Waiver:** Failure to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver of that provision.
- **Assignment:** You may not assign your rights under these terms. We may assign ours in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
